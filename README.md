# donation_app

A new Flutter application.

This app is built in flutter. This a donation app. Users can sign up and share the things they don't need anymore. They will upload their contacts and address if necessary. If someone needs something they can either communicate using the contacts provided by the post creator or drop a comment on the post. I did not add any backend to this app yet.
